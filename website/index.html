				<h3>Technical Projects</h3>
					<ul>
						<p class="tag">Serverless Website Frontend<br><span><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://digitalden.cloud" target="_blank">digitalden.cloud</a>.<br> <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> JavaScript, AWS SAM, AWS S3, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route 53 and AWS ACM.</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Frontend to digitalden.cloud.</li>
							<li>Built a simple landing page that hosts my online resume and multiple external links. </li>
							<li>Website is written in HTML and styled in CSS. Used AWS SAM CLI for Infrastructure as Code method and enabled CI/CD workflows with GitHub actions.</li>
							<li>The infrastructure on AWS includes a registered domain at digitalden.cloud, routing traffic using Amazon Route 53, HTTPS protocol for website security and CloudFront distribution for caching website content.</li>
							<li>Domain registration gives a unique name for the webpage, which was then configured using Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to the domain. The webpage is secured with the HTTPS protocol, encrypting data between users' browsers and web server. A CloudFront distribution is configured, which caches the webpages content at edge locations around the world for improved speed and reliability.</li>
							<br>
						</ul>
						<p class="tag">Serverless Website Backend<br><span><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://digitalden.cloud" target="_blank">digitalden.cloud</a>.<br> <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> AWS SAM, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB.</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Used AWS SAM CLI for Infrastructure as Code method & GitHub Actions for CI/CD. </li>
							<li>The pipeline consists of three jobs; infrastructure testing, build & deploy, and integration testing. Jobs are executed in sequential order and if the tests pass, the SAM application gets packaged and deployed to AWS.</li>
							<li>The website support a counter of visitors, which displays the latest visitor count. The visitor count value is stored in a DynamoDB database, which is accessed by a Lambda function written in Python3. The function is accessed through a REST API created, which when called will invoke the Lambda function and forward back the direct response due to a “Lambda proxy” configuration. </li>
							<li>Each time the page is loaded, a short JavaScript script utilizes Fetch API to ping the endpoint of the counter API, before rendering the response in the footer of the page. The website fetches and displays the latest visitor count, while the Lambda function handles incrementation as it interacted exclusively with the database.</li>
							<br>
						</ul>
						<p class="tag">Automating Incident Remediation With AWS Config And AWS Lambda<br><span><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> AWS IAM,  AWS Config, AWS Lambda, AWS CloudWatch</span>
						<ul>
							<li>Configured a solution to automatically remediate an incident where a security group's inbound rules no longer conformed with the desired configuration.</li>
							<li>Used AWS Config and AWS Lambda to monitor and automatically remediate security incidents related to EC2 security groups. Configured AWS Config to monitor changes to specific resources in my AWS account.</li>
							<li>AWS Config continuously monitors the EC2 security group settings and detects any changes that deviate from the desired configuration. It flags any changes as potential security concerns.</li>
							<li>Automated the remediation process by integrating AWS Config with AWS Lambda.</li>
							<li>When AWS Config detected a security incident, such as someone modifying a security group's inbound rules, it triggers the associated Lambda function. The Lambda function then takes remediation actions to bring the security group back into compliance with the desired configuration. For example, revoking unauthorized access.</li>
