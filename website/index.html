					<ul>
						<p class="tag">Serverless-Website-Frontend<br><span>Website: digitalden.cloud </span></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Frontend to digitalden.cloud. Built on AWS using SAM CLI for Infrastructure as Code and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. </li>
							<li>Once code is pushed to my Github repo, Github actions are triggered which automates the deployment of files to an S3 bucket and the invalidation of the corresponding CloudFront distribution cache.</li>
							<li>A simple, functional webpage that hosts multiple links that direct users to external websites. Webpage is written in HTML/JavaScript and is styled in CSS.</li>
							<li>Domain registration gives a unique name for the webpage, which was then configured using Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to the domain. The webpage is secured with the HTTPS protocol, encrypting data between users' browsers and web server. A CloudFront distribution is configured, which caches the webpages content at edge locations around the world for improved speed and reliability.</li>
							<br>
						</ul>
						<p class="tag">Serverless-Website-Backend<br><span>Website: digitalden.cloud </span></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Backend to digitalden.cloud. Built on AWS using SAM CLI for Infrastructure as Code and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. </li>
							<li>Built on AWS using SAM CLI for IaC method and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The pipeline consists of three jobs, infrastructure testing, build and deploy and integration testing, which are all executed in sequential order and If the tests pass, the SAM application gets packaged and deployed to AWS.</li>
							<li>The website has a visitor counter that uses a DynamoDB database and a Lambda function written in Python3 to manage the count. The Lambda function is accessed through a REST API created with API Gateway, which is configured to use a "Lambda proxy" configuration. </li>
							<li>The website uses a short JavaScript to fetch visitor count from the API endpoint and display it in the footer of the page. This architecture ensures that the visitor count is accurately tracked and avoids any concurrency issues.</li>
							<br>
